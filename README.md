# Neural-Tree-Software
The Adaptive Approximation Software Toolbox (Neural Tree Algorithm) is a function approximation and feature selection tool that uses genetic programming for constructing tree like structure to construct an adaptive multi-layer perceptron. This standalone software toolbox solves prediction problems. The developed algorithm performs multiobjective in which it adaptively creates simple models with high generalization ability.
